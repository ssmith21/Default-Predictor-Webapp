A machine learning application which predicts the probability of an individual defaulting on their credit card next month based on qualitative and financial data from the individual. 

Uses a custom deep neural network implemented with Tensorflow saved as an h5 file in the backend to make predictions from GET requests.

Front-end implemented with VUEjs.

Back-end is a custom API which uses the neural network, implemented with FLASK.

Deployed frontend and backend on two seperate heroku applications.
