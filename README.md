# Project overview

⋅⋅* Webapp which predicts the chance of an individual's credit card defaulting next month.

⋅⋅* Deployed with a tensorflow neural network in Flask API backend hosted on Heroku, achieves *82.1% binary validation accuracy* on whether an individual will default or not.

⋅⋅* Frontend created with VUEjs Framework hosted on Heroku seperately from the backend.

⋅⋅* Performed feature engineering, analyzed how each feature affects the chance of defaulting, explored the data with clustering and PCA reduction and presented my findings from the Jupyter notebook on the webapp.

⋅⋅* Tested/optimized 5 different supervised learning algorithms.
